# Messenger

A messaging website. I was thinking of a project to work on, and have been wanting to do something that works in real-time, so a messaging website came to mind. Learned a lot, like JWT authentication, cookies, refresh token rotation, message caching with Context API, and designing the system so all parts work and communicate nicely with each other.
